Project: New client onboarding platform
Date: 10 Dec

- We’re still waiting on the security team to confirm the data retention policy.
- Integration with the legacy CRM might be delayed because their team is short-staffed.
- Assumption: clients will upload documents via the new portal instead of email.
- If compliance change the KYC rules again, we may need to rework the form fields.
- Dependency on the external vendor for address verification API.
- Issue: current manual process is causing duplicate records and delays.s
